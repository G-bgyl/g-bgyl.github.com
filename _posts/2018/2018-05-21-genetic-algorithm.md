## Implement Genetic Algorithms(GA) with DEAP in Python

### Senario
Genetic algorithm can be used to solve a NP-hard problem and help to make decision. It can find a local optimal solution as a alternative solution when the global optimal solution will take too long to find.

As is showned in name, GA simulates the natural selection process. Usually, it randomly generate a population who contains individuals as potential solutions. It treat each potential solution as an individual, and select individuals based on the fitness adaptability to generate next generations over time.

The key of GA lies in four rules that made up of GA: fitness rules, selection rules, crossover rules, and mutation rules.

1. Fitness Rule
A fitness function is used to evaluate whether an individual is sutable for the final goal or not. An individual that is more sutable would think to be more fit to solve the problem, thus receive a higher probability of generating the next generation. For example, if we want to find out an
2. Selection rule


The key of a genetic algorithm is

[DEAP](http://deap.readthedocs.io/) is a python library that help user to build up genetic models to solve real world problems.

```
  print('Hello world.')
```
